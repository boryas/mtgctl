//! Cost-IR schema types.
//!
//! A `CostSchema` is the flat list of decisions the player must answer when
//! paying an `Action`-shaped cost. The schema is built by walking the cost
//! tree (`cost_exec::build_schema`) and answered by the strategy returning a
//! `BindEnv`. Once both exist, `cost_exec::pay` runs the cost via the regular
//! `executor::execute` — there is no second interpreter.
//!
//! Mana is intentionally NOT a `DecisionKind`. `Action::PayMana(mc)` reads
//! from the player's pool at execution time; if the pool can't pay, the
//! executor returns `ExecResult::ManaShortage` and the cost driver yields to
//! the strategy to activate mana abilities (each itself a PlayableAction).
//! The CR 601.2g sub-loop emerges from that interleaving.
