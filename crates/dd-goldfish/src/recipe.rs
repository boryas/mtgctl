//! SPIKE — validate the resource model on a real (UB tempo) list.
//!
//! The model (charter: `~/org/projects/mtgctl/dd-goldfish-strategy.org`):
//! resources are *legal actions* gated by `Object(Filter)` + fungible `Mana`;
//! actions chain by lining up produces↔consumes; we reason **backward** from the
//! goal `BBB + Doomsday-in-hand`, so choices are bound by the subgoal (no
//! heuristics) and the unsatisfied frontier *is* the gap.
//!
//! This is a SPIKE, not the production engine. Faithful simplifications, all
//! flagged, that the real version removes:
//!   1. The search works over **capability counts** extracted from card IR, not
//!      `obj_matches` grounding over individual object instances.
//!   2. Mana is tracked as a **black count**, not full per-colour `ManaPool`
//!      arithmetic — exact for the all-black DD goal (`BBB`, Dark Ritual's `B`).
//!   3. A ritual is "needs a 1-black seed → yields 3" (Dark Ritual shape), read
//!      from `added_mana_on_resolve`; richer ritual costs aren't modelled.
//!   4. Fetch type-matching is assumed: a fetch reaches black iff the deck has
//!      an untapped black land. Exact for this manabase; target depletion isn't
//!      counted. The real version grounds the fetch's search filter against the
//!      library via `obj_matches`.
//!
//! Even so, every capability below is *read structurally from IR* (never a card
//! name, except the payoff's identity), and the chaining is the real backward
//! production graph — so this exercises the model, not a parallel re-derivation.

// ── min-TTD: the optimistic "if everything goes perfectly" cast turn ──────────
//
// Three distinct quantities (see the dd-goldfish-strategy charter):
//   • ttd       — the random variable (E[ttd], P(ttd ≤ K); see `p_cast_by`/`e_ttd`).
//   • det-ttd   — the GUARANTEED turn using no draws (`deterministic_cast_turn`).
//   • min-ttd   — the OPTIMISTIC turn assuming the most helpful cards the library
//                 actually contains are drawn on schedule. A scalar bound, and
//                 always ≤ det-ttd (a lucky draw only helps). 3 black lands +
//                 Doomsday is det-ttd 3 but min-ttd 2 (a drawn petal/ritual).
//
// min-ttd is the feasibility gate: `min-ttd > cutoff` ⟹ even perfect luck can't
// cast by the cutoff ⟹ P(ttd ≤ cutoff) = 0, so a keep is dead (bin/shuffle and hope
// for a hand whose min-ttd ≤ cutoff). The gap det-ttd − min-ttd is the value of luck
// (and thus of digging).

/// (payoff → ritual → petal → untapped black / fetch → tapped black). These are the
/// cards a favorable draw would supply; used to compute the optimistic min-ttd.
